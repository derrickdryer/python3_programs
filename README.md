# python3_programs
Various python3 scripts created during my journey of learning the language.

All of these programs are free to use & reference. A lot of these are made for and during my time taking a python course I took for my Bachelors' of Science, Majoring in Computer Information Systems.  
Most of the programs were written with "Starting out with Python, Fourth Edition" by Tonny Gaddis in mind as many of them were exercises to do. Additionally, my course projects are listed here. These scipts are not maintained unless I am actively writing one of them.

Thank you for looking at my python journey.
